<h1><a href ="https://delaware.gov/">1: Delaware</a></h1>
<p5>The Delaware site is an excellent web site. It starts with a clean looking search bar, and has a number of pages below it laying out everything someone would need to know. This information seems to be ordered based on priority for the user, and offers a very clear few pages that layout everything. The color theme is done well, and there are rectangled shapes throughout, which tie everything together. Besides maybe a bit to much scrolling, i'd say the Delaware site is my favorite. </p5>

<h1><a href="https://www.nebraska.gov/">2: Nebraska</a></h1>
<p2>Overall, the Nebraska state website is put together extremely well. The color scheme works together, and the search bar provides a central / simple point that makes it easy to find whatever you need. In addition to this, the menu bar at the top allows the user to find more specific details, and the number of links below the search bar allow the user to quickly access commonly searched details. Furthermore, the graph showing the allocation of money, and the live twitter feed is an excellent touch. The only issue I had with this site was that the area around the search bar felt a bit cluttered.</p2>

<h1><a href = "https://www.illinois.gov/">3: Illinois</a></h1>
<p4>The Illinois state website has a number of different factors that make it a good website. For starters, it has nice color scheme, mostly organized layout, and clear directory for accessing information regarding the state. Aditionally, the virtual assistant is a nice touch considering it will give you a clear response, making it better than the search bars in my opinion. Regardless, the major issue with this site is that it feels like too much was thrown in the middle. There are different shaped links everywhere, and it feels a bit confusing. Besides that I would say it's one of my top sites.  </p4>

<h1><a href="https://www.myflorida.com/">4: Florida</a></h1>
<p3>The Flordia website is extremly simplistic with one central search bar, and a few links beneath it. While it is simple, this website looks very professional and has an excellent color scheme, as well as font contrast. Regardless this extremely simplistic theme makes the page difficult to navigate. It makes it difficult to know what to type in, and when a question is typed in a million results pop up. Overall, besides not having a few links to commonly searched items, everything is pretty solid on this website.</p3>


<h1><a href="https://alaska.gov/">5: Alaska</a></h1>
<p1> The color scheme of the Alaska state website is a variety of different blues, which provide an asthetically pleasing look. Furthermore the website loads quickly, the majority of the website is easy to navigate, and the page resizes for a number of different screens. Regardless, the page is quite confusing as there are number of different fonts, links, and directories scattered all over the page. Therefore, the further I scroll down on this page, the worse  it gets, and actual links, start looking like ads. Because of this I would say the Alaska state website is my least favorite.</p1>
