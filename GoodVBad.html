      Tesla:
      Due to a number of factors, one of the best websites I have seen is Tesla’s.
      For starters, the menu bar has 5 tabs, each leading to the 5 products Tesla sells on their site.
      The first of these tabs are Tesla models “S”, “3”, “X” and “Y,” which appear to spell out the word “Sexy.”
      While this may have been an unlikely error, there are still many factors that make this website extremely user friendly.
      In addition to the 5 menu tabs at the the top of the page,
      tesla has 5 pages that a user can scroll through which provide a minimal and brief description of their products.
      These pages integrate extremely well together by showing a sleek image with black text over top.
      Finally the transition from page to page fades the text in and out,
      offering an extremely smooth transition throughout the products. Overall, Tesla’s website is clean (with clean html5), easy to understand, and overall aesthetically pleasing.

      Apple: While Apple has many more products than Tesla, they still manage to make their website clean, and easy to navigate. One of the ways Apple makes their website clean is by using lots of blacks and whites, which makes their colorful products stand out. Their latest products are easy to access as they pop up right on the main page in a fashion similar to Tesla’s, being a photo of the product, and small black text overtop. Additionally the menu bar has ten tabs which all manage to fit perfectly at the top of a user's screen, and not look cluttered. All of these tabs lead to a different variation of the main page, however the page consists exclusively of the item they clicked on. While all of these topics are none that stand out from any other website, there is one area where Apple excels. This would be the realm of animation. As a user scrolls through a product description there are a number of colors, animations of the devices functionality, and close-up images of the device making the website feel alive.

      Yale: While I understand the purpose of this “creative” website, it still does not look good and is extremely confusing to navigate. There is no flow, and there are different shaped text boxes everywhere, making it so a user has no idea where to go or look when accessing the site. This is related to the idea that all the students have access to the page and can do whatever they want. This is not a terrible idea, however as a user actually interested in the art program I would have no idea where to look, and furthermore would not view this as a legitimate program. In conclusion, the text is extremely small, there is no “main” menu page because links are strewn everywhere, and the colors are not complementary.
